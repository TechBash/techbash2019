# Bluetooth Prototyping with the Raspberry Pi

Prototyping an iOT solution has never been easier! Learn the basics of using the Raspberry Pi, Python, WiFi, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to build the iOT device of your dreams. In this session, we will prototype a small iOT Hub and Device following the common design and architecture for most commercially marketed iOT devices.
